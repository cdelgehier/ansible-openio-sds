## Example Playbook

See the test playbooks in either the [Vagrant](https://github.com/cdelgehier/ansible-role-openio-sds/blob/vagrant-tests/test.yml) or [Docker](https://github.com/cdelgehier/ansible-role-openio-sds/blob/docker-tests/test.yml) test environment. See the section Testing for details.

## Testing

There are two types of test environments available. One powered by Vagrant, another by Docker. The latter is suitable for running automated tests on Travis-CI. Test code is kept in separate orphan branches. For details of how to set up these test environments on your own machine, see the README files in the respective branches:

- Vagrant: [vagrant-tests](https://github.com/cdelgehier/ansible-role-openio-sds/tree/vagrant-tests)
- Docker: [docker-tests](https://github.com/cdelgehier/ansible-role-openio-sds/tree/docker-tests)
